\addsec{Acknowledgments} % Danksagung/

After completing this thesis, I am grateful to everyone who have provided me with encouragement and support throughout my studies.

First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Beate Navarro Bullock, for her invaluable assistance, recommendations, and continual encouragement throughout my thesis. Her great insight and accuracy about my paper taught me so much that they are permanently etched in my mind. Throughout the course of my writing, she assisted me and provided me with valuable feedback, without which the paper would not be what it is now.

Also, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Liu Liu, for giving me not only the direction for my thesis, but also for giving me a lot of guidance regarding the database. He helped me a lot when I was confused or had difficulties in setting up the project environment and collecting test data in the enterprise.

Finally, I would like to thank my professors at THI and my colleagues at ZD-Automotive who taught me.\\ [1.5cm]
